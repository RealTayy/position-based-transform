v1.0.0b goals:
- Add reverseTranslateX and reverseTranslateY options.
- Add tiltX/tiltY/reverseTiltX/reverseTiltY options.
- Start Documentation.
X change variables name offset to translate.

Patch notes:
- `ignoreChildren` and `ignoreOthers` has been removed until due to a bug with specific cases (more details in known bugs below). All initialzation will default to the global event listener until this bug has been fixed.

FIXED:
- Bug where hovering over hoverTarget's children (that have been translated) would allow the mousemove to extend past hoverTarget's box.

KNOWN BUGS:
- #1 Enabling ignoreChildren causes "mouseleave" to not be properly detected if hoverTarget's children extend past the hoverTarget's box.
