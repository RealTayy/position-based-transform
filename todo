v1.0.0b goals:
- Add reverse options.
- Start Documentation.

Patch notes:
- Add tiltX/tiltY options.
- `ignoreChildren` and `ignoreOthers` has been removed until due to a bug with specific cases (more details in known bugs below). All initialzation will default to the global event listener until this bug has been fixed.
- Added option to define both X and Y axis transforms options through single option (ex: `maxTiltX` and `maxTiltY` can be defined though just `maxTilt`);
- Many variable names have been changed to make more sense.
- No longer adds unnecessary transform options if it wasn't defined in options.

FIXED:
- Bug where hovering over hoverTarget's children (that have been translated) would allow the mousemove to extend past hoverTarget's box.

KNOWN BUGS:
- #1 Enabling ignoreChildren causes "mouseleave" to not be properly detected if hoverTarget's children extend past the hoverTarget's box.
