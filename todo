- Incorporate jQuery targeting for initialization
- Do I need to calc the hypo? Probably not
- Use getComputedStyle() & getPropertyValue() to determine starting transform values so you can use library on properties with transforms already on them.
- resetPosition should get the initial properties of transform target instead of just setting transform to nothing.
