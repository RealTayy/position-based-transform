v1.0.0c goals:
- Start Documentation.

Patch notes:
- Change user friendly variables names.
- Add reverse options.
- - Add ability to pass in just a number into translate rather having it be a string everytime

FIXED:
- Bug where if you are using the tilt option and rapidly hover and unhover(is that a word?) over the hoverTarget the browser would not correctly add/remove the perpective property in time and things go all crazy.

KNOWN BUGS:
- #1 Enabling ignoreChildren causes "mouseleave" to not be properly detected if hoverTarget's children extend past the hoverTarget's box.
