Patch notes:
- There was on known bug with the initial release with `ignoreChildren` and `ignoreOthers` optoin when intializating. They were not included in the released version but I kept the code in order to maybe fix it later. Now that I think about it there aren't many use cases for those two options so from this version version they have been removed from the javascript completely.
- Change default perpective to 500px.

Addtional Features:
- Added perpective option.
- You can now pass in duration as a string or a number. If it was passed in a number it will treat it as milliseconds.

FIXED:
- Bug where resetPosition was not properly reseting if you had a `tilt` option.

KNOWN BUGS:
- #1 Enabling ignoreChildren causes "mouseleave" to not be properly detected if hoverTarget's children extend past the hoverTarget's box.
