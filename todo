v1.0.1 goals:
- Start Documentation.

Patch notes:

Addtional Features:
- Add `disable()`/`enable()`/`toggle()` methods. This allows user to disable/enable all transition effects.
- Add `enterCB` and `leaveCB` properties for options. Allows user to set a callback function that fire when the mouse enter/leaves the `hoverTarget`.

FIXED:
- Bug where if you pass in an `initialTransform` option it doesn't apply the initialTransform if you don't also pass in a relevant regular transform.
- Bug where `perpective` is added even though a `tilt` option was not passed in.

KNOWN BUGS:
- #1 Enabling ignoreChildren causes "mouseleave" to not be properly detected if hoverTarget's children extend past the hoverTarget's box.
